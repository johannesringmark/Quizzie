Quizzie is a hands-free, voice-only quiz platform designed to help users rehearse and learn a variety of topics using spaced repetition. The primary selling point of Quizzie is its commitment to accessibility and convenience: all interactions are performed through voice, making it ideal for users who want to study or reinforce knowledge while on the move or without using their hands.

Whether you're out on a jog or driving to and from work, Quizzie lets you rehearse and reinforce knowledge without needing to touch a screen or device.
